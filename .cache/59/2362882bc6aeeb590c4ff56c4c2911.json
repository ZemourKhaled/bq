links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * ### Linked State\n * The attribute value of the `ui-sref` is the name of the state to link to.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This will activate the `home` state when the link is clicked.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Relative Links\n * You can also use relative state paths within `ui-sref`, just like a relative path passed to `$state.go()` ([[StateService.go]]).\n * You just need to be aware that the path is relative to the state that *created* the link.\n * This allows a state to create a relative `ui-sref` which always targets the same destination.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Both these links are relative to the parent state, even when a child state is currently active.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\".child1\">child 1 state</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\".child2\">child 2 state</a>\n * ```\n *\n * This link activates the parent state.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"^\">Return</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### hrefs\n * If the linked state has a URL, the directive will automatically generate and\n * update the `href` attribute (using the [[StateService.href]]  method).\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Assuming the `users` state has a url of `/users/`\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"users\" href=\"/users/\">Users</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Parameter Values\n * In addition to the state name, a `ui-sref` can include parameter values which are applied when activating the state.\n * Param values can be provided in the `ui-sref` value after the state name, enclosed by parentheses.\n * The content inside the parentheses is an expression, evaluated to the parameter values.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This example renders a list of links to users.\n * The state's `userId` parameter value comes from each user's `user.id` property.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"user in users\">\n *   <a ui-sref=\"users.detail({ userId: user.id })\">{{ user.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * Note:\n * The parameter values expression is `$watch`ed for updates.\n *\n * ### Transition Options\n * You can specify [[TransitionOptions]] to pass to [[StateService.go]] by using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute.\n * Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`, and `reload`.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\" ui-sref-opts=\"{ reload: true }\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Other DOM Events\n *\n * You can also customize which DOM events to respond to (instead of `click`) by\n * providing an `events` array in the `ui-sref-opts` attribute.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\" ui-sref=\"contacts\" ui-sref-opts=\"{ events: ['change', 'blur'] }\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Highlighting the active link\n * This directive can be used in conjunction with [[uiSrefActive]] to highlight the active link.\n *\n * ### Examples\n * If you have the following template:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">{{ contact.name }}</a>\n *     </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Then (assuming the current state is `contacts`) the rendered html including hrefs would be:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a href=\"#/home\" ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * <a href=\"#/about\" ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n * <a href=\"#/contacts?page=2\" ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/1\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Joe</a>\n *     </li>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/2\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Alice</a>\n *     </li>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a href=\"#/contacts/3\" ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">Bob</a>\n *     </li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * <a href=\"#/home\" ui-sref=\"home\" ui-sref-opts=\"{reload: true}\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Notes\n *\n * - You can use `ui-sref` to change **only the parameter values** by omitting the state name and parentheses.\n * #### Example:\n * Sets the `lang` parameter to `en` and remains on the same state.\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"{ lang: 'en' }\">English</a>\n * ```\n *\n * - A middle-click, right-click, or ctrl-click is handled (natively) by the browser to open the href in a new window, for example.\n *\n * - Unlike the parameter values expression, the state name is not `$watch`ed (for performance reasons).\n * If you need to dynamically update the state being linked to, use the fully dynamic [[uiState]] directive.\n */\nlet uiSrefDirective: ng1_directive;\nuiSrefDirective = [\n  '$uiRouter',\n  '$timeout',\n  function $StateRefDirective($uiRouter: UIRouter, $timeout:

directive for linking to a state\n *\n * A directive which links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * **This directive is very similar to [[uiSref]], but it `$observe`s and `$watch`es/evaluates all its inputs.**\n *\n * A directive which links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * ### Linked State\n * The attribute value of `ui-state` is an expression which is `$watch`ed and evaluated as the state to link to.\n * **This is in contrast with `ui-sref`, which takes a state name as a string literal.**\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Create a list of links.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"link in navlinks\">\n *   <a ui-state=\"link.state\">{{ link.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Relative Links\n * If the expression evaluates to a relative path, it is processed like [[uiSref]].\n * You just need to be aware that the path is relative to the state that *created* the link.\n * This allows a state to create relative `ui-state` which always targets the same destination.\n *\n * ### hrefs\n * If the linked state has a URL, the directive will automatically generate and\n * update the `href` attribute (using the [[StateService.href]]  method).\n *\n * ### Parameter Values\n * In addition to the state name expression, a `ui-state` can include parameter values which are applied when activating the state.\n * Param values should be provided using the `ui-state-params` attribute.\n * The `ui-state-params` attribute value is `$watch`ed and evaluated as an expression.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This example renders a list of links with param values.\n * The state's `userId` parameter value comes from each user's `user.id` property.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"link in navlinks\">\n *   <a ui-state=\"link.state\" ui-state-params=\"link.params\">{{ link.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Options\n * You can specify [[TransitionOptions]] to pass to [[StateService.go]] by using the `ui-state-opts` attribute.\n * Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`, and `reload`.\n * The value of the `ui-state-opts` is `$watch`ed and evaluated as an expression.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <a ui-state=\"returnto.state\" ui-state-opts=\"{ reload: true }\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Other DOM Events\n *\n * You can also customize which DOM events to respond to (instead of `click`) by\n * providing an `events` array in the `ui-state-opts` attribute.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\" ui-state=\"contacts\" ui-state-opts=\"{ events: ['change', 'blur'] }\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Highlighting the active link\n * This directive can be used in conjunction with [[uiSrefActive]] to highlight the active link.\n *\n * ### Notes\n *\n * - You can use `ui-params` to change **only the parameter values** by omitting the state name and supplying only `ui-state-params`.\n *   However, it might be simpler to use [[uiSref]] parameter-only links.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Sets the `lang` parameter to `en` and remains on the same state.\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-state=\"\" ui-state-params=\"{ lang: 'en' }\">English</a>\n * ```\n *\n * - A middle-click,

and `ui-sref-active-eq`: A directive that adds a CSS class when a `ui-sref` is active\n *\n * A directive working alongside [[uiSref]] and [[uiState]] to add classes to an element when the\n * related directive's state is active (and remove them when it is inactive).\n *\n * The primary use-case is to highlight the active link in navigation menus,\n * distinguishing it from the inactive menu items.\n *\n * ### Linking to a `ui-sref` or `ui-state`\n * `ui-sref-active` can live on the same element as `ui-sref`/`ui-state`, or it can be on a parent element.\n * If a `ui-sref-active` is a parent to more than one `ui-sref`/`ui-state`, it will apply the CSS class when **any of the links are active**.\n *\n * ### Matching\n *\n * The `ui-sref-active` directive applies the CSS class when the `ui-sref`/`ui-state`'s target state **or any child state is active**.\n * This is a \"fuzzy match\" which uses [[StateService.includes]].\n *\n * The `ui-sref-active-eq` directive applies the CSS class when the `ui-sref`/`ui-state`'s target state is directly active (not when child states are active).\n * This is an \"exact match\" which uses [[StateService.is]].\n *\n * ### Parameter values\n * If the `ui-sref`/`ui-state` includes parameter values, the current parameter values must match the link's values for the link to be highlighted.\n * This allows a list of links to the same state with different parameters to be rendered, and the correct one highlighted.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"user in users\" ui-sref-active=\"active\">\n *   <a ui-sref=\"user.details({ userId: user.id })\">{{ user.lastName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Examples\n *\n * Given the following template:\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <ul>\n *   <li ui-sref-active=\"active\" class=\"item\">\n *     <a href ui-sref=\"app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})\">@bilbobaggins</a>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * When the app state is `app.user` (or any child state),\n * and contains the state parameter \"user\" with value \"bilbobaggins\",\n * the resulting HTML will appear as (note the 'active' class):\n *\n * ```html\n * <ul>\n *   <li ui-sref-active=\"active\" class=\"item active\">\n *     <a ui-sref=\"app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})\" href=\"/users/bilbobaggins\">@bilbobaggins</a>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Glob mode\n *\n * It is possible to pass `ui-sref-active` an expression that evaluates to an object.\n * The objects keys represent active class names and values represent the respective state names/globs.\n * `ui-sref-active` will match if the current active state **includes** any of\n * the specified state names/globs, even the abstract ones.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Given the following template, with \"admin\" being an abstract state:\n * ```html\n * <div ui-sref-active=\"{'active': 'admin.**'}\">\n *   <a ui-sref-active=\"active\" ui-sref=\"admin.roles\">Roles</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Arrays are also supported as values in the `ngClass`-like interface.\n * This allows multiple states to add `active` class.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Given the following template, with \"admin.roles\" being the current state, the class will be added too:\n * ```html\n * <div ui-sref-active=\"{'active': ['owner.**', 'admin.**']}\">\n *   <a ui-sref-active=\"active\" ui-sref=\"admin.roles\">Roles</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the current state is \"admin.roles\" the \"active\" class will be applied to both the `<div>` and `<a>` elements.\n * It is important to note that the state names/globs passed to `ui-sref-active` override any state provided by a linked `ui-sref`.\n *\n * ### Notes:\n *\n * - The class name is interpolated **once** during the directives link time (any further changes to the\n * interpolated value are ignored).\n *\n * - Multiple classes may be specified in a space-separated format: `ui-sref-active='class1 class2 class3'`\n
